# node quick start with js
This contains a repo you can **fork** (don't clone/push) to get quickly started with test-driven js.

Once cloned run ```npm ci``` then ```npm test``` (using npm ci rather than npm install will ensure a clean install). All the tests should fail see the Example tests section below.

A Sample function is in ```src/index.js``` with a corresponding test in ```__tests__/main.tests.js``` to get you started.

Its based on the quickstart in the [gist](https://gist.github.com/tallus/22ec187eeb7f77ff1d4318239f3676e3)

Its expected that you run the current stable node version. (12.3.0). You should
use ```nvm``` to manage this: see the [gist](https://gist.github.com/tallus/22ec187eeb7f77ff1d4318239f3676e3) for more details.



## Example tests
Included in the ```__tests__``` directory is ```example.tests.js```

This contains failing tests that will introduce you to the basics of
[jest](https://jestjs.io/) the testing framework used.

You can safely delete this file if not needed or add the following
to package.json so its ignored.
```
"testPathIgnorePatterns": [
      "/node_modules/",
      "__tests__/example.tests.js",
    ]
  }
}

This repo was setup for working with apprentices.
